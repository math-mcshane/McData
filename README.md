# McData
Professor McShane's collection of datasets; from a variety of places...

At this time, this is a single dataset package, although I plan to add more over time. This is a work-in-progress package.

To install the CRAN version, simply use:

```
install.packages("McData")
```

To install the development version, I suggest using `pak`:

```
pak::pkg_install("github::math-mcshane/McData")
```

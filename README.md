# McData
Professor McShane's collection of datasets; from a variety of places...

At this time, this is a single dataset package, although I plan to add more over time. This is a work-in-progress package.

To install this _alpha_ version, I suggest using `pak`. 

```
pak::pkg_install("github::math-mcshane/McData")
```
